###Future Features
  Venue Page with links to their website, and having real time data on each venues tap list. This would allow us to alert users when a specific beer they have starred comes on tap at a bar near them.

  Incorporate Untapped's API and Yelp's API. This will give us a very large selection of beers and breweries to search from. With both of those we can add in more filtering options. The Yelp API will allow us to validate venues, and give the user the opportunity to link to their Yelp page.
